Limitations and Potential Improvements

 Limitations:

1. The model may struggle with certain art styles or complex compositions.
2. Content images are resized to 224x224, potentially losing some details.
3. The model heavily relies on the pre-trained VGG19 model, limiting the diversity of artistic styles captured.

Potential Improvements:

1. Experiment with more advanced neural network architectures for style transfer.
2. Fine-tune hyperparameters for better results across various styles and content images.
3. Train the model on a more diverse dataset of artistic styles to improve generalization.
4. Develop a user-friendly interface for easy input and visualization.
